<p class="ingress"> According to a new study by researchers at the Washington School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, the humpback whale population in the South Atlantic has recovered nicely after being almost extinct in the early 1900s.  </p>

  
   <p>

    It was undoubtedly twelve years in the beginning of the 20th century that whale hunters killed around 25,000 humpback whales, which led to the population dropping to around 450 individuals. This was noticed in the 1960s, and they began to introduce some protection for the electorate, which was expanded when the International Election Commission banned all commercial whaling in the mid-1980s.
    
    Researchers now say that there are again around 25,000 humpback whales in the southern Atlantic, which contradicts a report previously released by the International Election Commission. The report, which had studied the knuckle whale population between 2006 - 2015, stated that the electoral stock was about 30 percent of the stock that existed before the commercial hunt started on a large scale.
    
    The fact that the new study shows a completely different result than the International Election Commission's report is explained by the fact that new data has been added that has allowed researchers to more accurately calculate the size of the bone-picking population in the southern Atlantic.</p>
