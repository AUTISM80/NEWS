<p class="ingress">  WASHINGTON DC. Cancer researcher Nicola Curtin received just over ten million for a new drug. 

  Now she chooses to give away all the compensation. 
  
  - As for most researchers, it is not the money that drives me, she says according to British Metro.  </p>


  <p> Professor Nicola Curtin is one of the researchers at Newcastle University who was behind the drug Rubraca, which is used to eradicate tumors in cancer patients. 

    After it has been approved by the British NHS for the treatment of cancer patients, Nicola Curtin has received royalty payments of the equivalent of SEK 10.7 million. 
    
    But instead of keeping the money, she has decided to help needy people and make sure they get a chance to develop their knowledge, talents and get a better chance of education or work. </p>
    
   Â¨
   
   <h2> "Not the money that drives me" </h2>
   
   
   
    <p> The researcher tells Metro that she could have bought another house, but that she is already paid for the job she is doing. 
    
    - As for most researchers, it is not the money that drives me, it is the intellectual challenge and feeling I get from thinking of something before everyone else knows it, she says.  
    
    About donating the money to the needy in society, she says:  
    
     
    <h2> Used for ovarian cancer </h2>
    
    <p> - I know that life is not fair and that there are people who have a hard time and those people can have talents that could be used with a little money. The purpose of this fund is to give them these opportunities. Not only will it help them, but it's also good for the country. It is not good for the country if we neglect talent, says Nicola Curtin.
    
    The rights to the drug were sold by universities and will bring in about SEK 400 million for six years. 
    
    According to Curtin, Rubraca, used in the treatment of ovarian cancer, has been shown to be effective in 50 to 55 percent of cases.  </p>
